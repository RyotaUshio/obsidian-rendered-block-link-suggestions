# Obsidian Rendered Block Link Suggestions

This is an [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) plugin that enhances the built-in block link suggestion (the auto-completion triggered when typing `[[note title^` or `[[^`) by rendering markdown in it.

## Installation

Since this plugin is still in beta, it's not on the community plugin browser yet.

But you can install the latest beta release using [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat):

1.  Install BRAT and enable it.
2.  Go to `Options`. In the `Beta Plugin List` section, click on the `Add Beta plugin` button.
3.  Copy and paste `RyotaUshio/obsidian-rendered-block-link-suggestions` in the pop-up prompt and click on **Add Plugin**.
4.  _(Optional but highly recommended)_ Turn on `Auto-update plugins at startup` at the top of the page.
5.  Go to `Community plugins > Installed plugins`. You will find “Rendered Block Link Suggestions” in the list. Click on the toggle button to enable it.
